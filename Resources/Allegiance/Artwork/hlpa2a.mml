Training missions are the only part of
Allegiance you can play in offline mode. It
is highly recommended that you play through the training missions
before actually connecting to the Internet or your LAN, as Allegiance has
a fairly high learning curve.<p><p>

There are six missions, each providing a brief taste of what Allegiance
is all about. They are intended to show you what to expect, give you some
basic training, and get you online as quickly as possible.<p><p>
